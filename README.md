# Branch Policies
**Policies for the IEEE WPI Student Branch.**

## Bylaws
The bylaws are located at `bylaws/bylaws.pdf`.

In order to build the bylaws you will need to have LaTeX installed. 
Installation instructions for all operating systems can be found at https://www.latex-project.org/get/

With LaTeX installed, open a shell, navigate to the `bylaws/tex` directory, and run the build script.
```bash
cd bylaws/tex
./build
```
This will build the bylaws.pdf file.


## Lounge Policy
The lounge policy is located at `lounge_policy/lounge_policy.pdf`
