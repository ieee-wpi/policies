\subsection*{Lounge Policy}
By gaining access to WPI's IEEE Lounge in AK 106, you agree to abide by the following rules. Having our own space on campus is a privilege, and these rules help keep the space functional and clean for everyone!

\begin{enumerate}
    \item{Do not take other people's belongings. This includes, but is not limited to, food, electronics, and personal items.}
    \item{Do not remove shared items from the lounge. This includes, but is not limited to, supplies, furniture, and equipment.}
    \item{Clean up after you leave. This includes, but is not limited to, making sure the shared surfaces are kept tidy.}
    \item{Do not host meetings in the lounge, unless they are related to IEEE.}
    \item{Do not leave food in the fridge for more than a week.}
    \item{Be nice to others! We're all friends here :)}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent We're trying to build an open, fun, collaborative place on campus. This space belongs to all of us â€” we want you to bring your personal touch and help make it better! There aren't any rules on what should/shouldn't be in the lounge, so feel free to bring whatever you want. If there's something you think the club should purchase or restock, please let the executive board know!
